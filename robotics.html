  <h1>Robotics Projects</h1>
    <section id="about">
    <p>
      Some of my best robotics projects. I started off in the PROtotype Object Fabrication (PROOF) Lab, learning with a hands-on 
      approach. I then delved into the linear algebra that explained how it all worked. Some of my projects are research-driven, some built under extremely 
      tight deadlines, and some are just for fun. All of my projects have pushed me to think harder, build smarter, and 
      occasionally question my life choices.

    <h2>LeRobot Arm Hackathon NYC</h2>
    <h4>SO-100 robot arm was built and calibrated. Mechanical and electrical noise were separated, and a filter was applied 
      to the electrical noise to reduce robot trembling, and we were able to increase trajectory speed by 200%. All done in 
      a 30-hour window, team won $1000 prize for “Most Innovative Use of Data.” Robot arm demonstrated functionality of 
      picking up a pen and drawing autonomously, using camera vision as feedback.  </h4>

      SLAM and Kalman filtering was used to calculate the uncertainty (red ellipses) at each time step. 100 instances 
      were run, and different optimization parameters were analyzed for effectiveness. Shown is shortest path found (left)

    <h2>SESMA 3.0 - Soft Exosuit for Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy</h2>
      <h4>Device helps patients stand independently using cables routed down leg. 8 markers were placed to simulate cable path,
         and 3D splines were used to simulate a cable. Numerical techniques then used to discretize the data to calculate the 
         change in length from cable during sit to stand transitions. This was implemented in parallel with PID compensation 
         to monitor transitions for real-time feedback and autonomous activation when needed. Final Prototype was 3D printed
